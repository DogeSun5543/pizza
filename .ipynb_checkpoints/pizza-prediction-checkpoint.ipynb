    "# Pizza Sales Prediction Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "## Statement:\n",
    "In the bustling world of the food industry, understanding sales patterns is crucial for businesses to thrive. This notebook aims to predict pizza sales, allowing pizzerias to optimize their inventory, staff schedules, and marketing strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem to Solve:\n",
    "Predicting the number of pizzas a pizzeria will sell on any given day can be a challenging task. Factors such as day of the week, holidays, promotions, and even weather can influence sales. Accurate predictions can lead to better inventory management, reduced food waste, optimized staffing, and increased profitability. The goal is to develop a model that can predict daily pizza sales based on various influencing factors."

    "## Overview of the Solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Collection:\n",
    "\n",
    "Gather historical sales data from the pizzeria, including the number of pizzas sold each day.\n",
    "Collect additional data that might influence sales, such as day of the week, whether it was a holiday, any promotions or events held, and local weather conditions.\n",
    "Data Exploration:\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualize the sales data to identify patterns and trends. For instance, are sales higher on weekends? Do promotions lead to a spike in sales?\n",
    "Explore correlations between sales and other factors. Does rainy weather lead to increased pizza delivery orders?\n",
    "Feature Engineering:\n",
    "\n",
    "Convert categorical data, like days of the week, into numerical data.\n",
    "Create new features if necessary. For example, a binary feature indicating whether the day had a promotion or not.\n",
    "Model Selection:\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the nature of the data, select appropriate regression models. Potential candidates could be Linear Regression, RandomForestRegressor, or GradientBoostingRegressor from sklearn.\n",
    "Hyperparameter Tuning:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use techniques like Grid Search and Random Search to find the optimal parameters for the chosen models.\n",
    "Model Training:\n",
    "\n",
    "Split the data into training and validation sets.\n",
    "Train the models on the training set and validate their performance on the validation set.\n",
    "Evaluation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to evaluate the model's performance on the validation set.\n",
    "Deployment:\n",
    "\n",
    "Once satisfied with the model's performance, deploy it in a real-world setting. The pizzeria can then input the relevant factors for any given day and get a sales prediction."
